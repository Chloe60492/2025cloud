## How to Build the Application Environment with Docker

### Dockerfile Overview
1. Base Image Selection
   - The base image is `python:3.11-slim`, which is a lightweight version of Python 3.11.
   - This image is suitable for running Python applications with a smaller footprint.
2. Working Directory
   - The working directory is set to `/app`, which is where the application code will reside.
3. Copy the Requirements File
   - The `requirements.txt` file is copied into the working directory. This file contains a list of Python packages required for the application.
4. Install Dependencies
   - The `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt` command installs the required Python packages without caching them, which helps to keep the image size smaller.
5. Copy the Application Code
   - The entire application code is copied into the working directory. This includes all necessary files for the application to run.
6. Expose Ports
   - The Dockerfile exposes port `8000`, which is the default port for the application to listen on. This allows external access to the application.
7. Command to Run the Application
   - The command `python manage.py runserver

### Build the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, run the following command:
```
docker build -t my-python-app .
```
The -t option allows you to assign a name (tag) to the image. You can replace my-python-app with any desired name.

### Verify the Image Build
To verify that the image was built successfully, you can list all Docker images using the following command:
```
docker images
```

### Run the Docker Container
To run the Docker container, use the following command:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-python-app
```
Then, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
